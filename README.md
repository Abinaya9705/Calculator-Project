# Calculator Project
This is my first project on GitHub. And my  first experience on GitHub.
The Calculator Project is a basic application designed to perform arithmetic operations. 
It is a beginner-friendly project ideal for learning programming fundamentals, version control with Git, and project collaboration on GitHub. 
This project allows users to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It can be enhanced with advanced features like trigonometric calculations, a graphical user interface, or integration with other tools.
